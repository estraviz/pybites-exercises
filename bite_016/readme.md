# Bite 16. PyBites date generator

Write a generator that returns special dates for PyBites:

Every year mark counting from `PYBITES_BORN` date
Every 100 days mark counting from `PYBITES_BORN`
See the tests for more details how your code will be tested: as this is a beginner's challenge we only calculate a few years ahead, leaving the next leap year (2020) out of this challenge.

We will revisit this in an intermediate challenge. Have fun!
