# Bite 155. Split a string by spaces or quoted text

##Â Description

Another text manipulation Bite. Code `split_words_and_quoted_text` that takes a text string and splits it by space, except words that are wrapped between double quotes ("), these spaces needs to be preserved.

So passing it _Should give "3 words only"_, it would return a list of 3 (not 5) elements: _['Should', 'give', '3 words only']_ (note that the double quotes are stripped off as well).

Check out the standard library, there might be a tool for the job ;) - good luck and keep calm and code in Python!
