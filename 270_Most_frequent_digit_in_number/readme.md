# Bite 270. Most frequent digit in number

## Description

Given an integer number, find the most frequent digit in it.

Examples:

* 1998 -> two 9's, one 1, one 8 so return 9
* 177 -> return 7
* 2020 -> there is 2 two's, 2 zero's. Return 2 = the first highest hitter
* 12345 -> all digits occur once, so like the last example return the first digit = 1
