# Bite 104. Split and join

Split up the message on newline (\n) using the `split` builtin, then use the `join` builtin to stitch it together using a '|' (pipe).

So `Hello world:\nI am coding in Python :)\nHow awesome!` would turn into: `Hello world:|I am coding in Python :)|How awesome!`

Your code should work for other message strings as well.
