# Bite 115. Count leading spaces

##Â Description

A small but interesting Bite: given a string with leading indent spacing, calculate the amount of space (literal space, not tab or newline) characters:

* `'string  '` -> 0 (we only care about leading spacing)
* `'  string'` -> 2
* `'    string'` -> 4
* etc...

This can be done in many ways so once done we encourage you to go into the Bite forum (_Discussion_ tab that appears upon solving the Bite) to discuss your solution with fellow Pythonistas ... Have fun!
