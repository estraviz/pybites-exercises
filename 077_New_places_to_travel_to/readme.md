# Bite 77. New places to travel to

##Â Description

You want to find people who have as much exposure to different cultures as yourself.

Complete the `uncommon_cities` helper that takes the cities you have visited (`my_cities`) and the cities the other person has visited (`other_cities`) and returns the number of cities that both sequences do NOT have in common.

So given [A B C] and [B C D] it should return 2 because only A and D are different.

You can loop through both sequences but maybe there is a more concise way to do it?
