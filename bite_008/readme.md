# Bite 8. Rotate string characters

Write a function that rotates characters in a string, in both directions:

* if n is positive move characters from beginning to end, e.g.: `rotate('hello', 2)` would return `llohe`.
* if n is negative move characters to the start of the string, e.g.: `rotate('hello', -2)` would return `lohel`.

See tests for more info. Have fun!
