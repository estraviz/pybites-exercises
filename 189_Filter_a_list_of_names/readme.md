# Bite 189. Filter a list of names

##Â Description

Here is a Bite to practice the `continue` and `break` statements in Python.

Complete `filter_names` that takes a `list` of names and returns a filtered `list` (or generator) of names using the following conditions:

1. names that start with `IGNORE_CHAR` are ignored,
2. names that have one or more digits are ignored,
3. if a name starts with `QUIT_CHAR` it inmediately exits the loop, so no more names are added/generated at this point (neither the `QUIT_CHAR` name),
4. return up till `MAX_NAMES` names max.

Good luck and keep calm and code in Python!
