# Bite 130. Analyze some basic Car Data

## Description

In this exercise you will analyze some basic car data. Here is the (fake) JSON data we created with [Mockeroo](https://www.mockaroo.com/) - snippet below / full output [here](https://bit.ly/2Ov65SJ):

```python
  [{"id":1,"automaker":"Dodge","model":"Ram Van 1500","year":1999},
   {"id":2,"automaker":"Chrysler","model":"Town & Country","year":2002},
   {"id":3,"automaker":"Porsche","model":"Cayenne","year":2008},
   ... 997 car entries more ...
  ]
```

First you will write `most_prolific_automaker` to find out which automaker produces the most new models for a particular year.

Secondly you will write `get_models` which filters the data set down to car models produced by a particular _automaker_ and year (as passed into the function).

To keep it a Beginner Bite we'll pause here, but if you like this data set, let us know and we make a follow-up Bite, maybe we can add some financial data :)

Check out the _docstrings_ and _pytests_ and give it a shot. Good luck and keep calm keep and code in Python.
