# Bite 28. Converting date strings to datetimes

## Description

In this Bite you are provided with a list of publish dates of all our PyBites blog posts. They are in this format: _Thu, 04 May 2017 20:46:00 +0200._

Write a function called `convert_to_datetime` that takes a date string and convert it to a `datetime` object. You can leave the timezone part (e.g. +0200) off.

Secondly complete the `get_month_most_posts` function: it should take a list of `datetime` objects and return the month that we posted the most. You should get **2017-01**. See also the TESTS tab how your code will be tested.

Have fun and let us know how you experienced this Bite. Have fun!
