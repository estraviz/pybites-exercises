# Bite 210. Add Type Annotations

##Â Description

Continuing from where we left off in [Bite 209](https://github.com/estraviz/pybites-exercises/tree/master/209_Write_a_Sphinx_docstring), use the `docstring` you wrote in last Bite to add type annotations to the `sum_numbers` function.

Note that you will need to import one of the types from the [`typing` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html). Again no need to implement the function. It's about typing here. Have fun!
