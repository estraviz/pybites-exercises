# Bite 128. Work with datetime's strptime and strftime

## Description

In this Bite you get some more practice with `datetime`'s useful `strptime` and `strftime`.

Complete the two functions: `years_ago` and `convert_eu_to_us_date` following the instructions in their _docstrings._

This is the defintion and difference between the two:

* `strptime`: _parse (convert) string to datetime object._
* `strftime`: _create formatted string for given time/date/datetime object according to specified format._

Reference: [8.1.8. strftime() and strptime() Behavior](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-strptime-behavior). Good luck and keep calm and code in Python!
