# Bite 43. Force keyword arguments

## Description

Write a function called `get_profile` that can only allows 2 keyword arguments: `name` and `profession` which default to _julian_ and _programmer_ respectively.

The function does nothing fancy, just return a `str`: _`name`_ is a _`profession`_.

The point is to limit the interface of this function and you'll see Python makes it very easy ... have fun!
