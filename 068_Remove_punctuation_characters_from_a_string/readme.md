# Bite 68. Remove punctuation characters from a string

## Description

Complete `remove_punctuation` which receives an input string and strips out all punctuation characters (```!"#$%&\'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~```).

Return the resulting string. You can go full loop, list comprehension or maybe some nice [stdlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html) functionality?
