# Bite 262. GC content

## Description

The DNA of all organsims consists of the letters (bases) _A, C, T_ and _G_. Every organism has a different ratio of these bases, known as the _[GC content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GC-content)_. This information can not only give clues about the origin of genetic material but can also help to determine how closely related some organisms are.

For the given DNA sequences calculate the _GC content_ as a percentage of all (allowed) bases (=percentage of the letters G or C).

```
Example:
DNA Sequence:
AAAAAAAATTTTTTGGGGCC
A=8, T=6, G=4, C=2, TOTAL = 20
GC content = n(G|C) / n(A|C|G|T) = 6/20 = 3/10 => 30%
```
