# Bite 191. Starwars character with highest BMI

## Description

In this Bite you will parse a multiline string of [SWAPI Starwars characters](https://web.archive.org/web/20200308060853/https://swapi.co/).

Calculate the BMI of each character returning a (person, [BMI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index)) `tuple` of the character that has the highest BMI.

The BMI calculation is the same as [Bite 56](https://codechalleng.es/bites/56/): `float(mass) / ((int(height) / 100) ** 2)`.

The provided `data` contains 3 columns separated by comma: person, height, and mass.

Have fun and keep calm and code in Python!
