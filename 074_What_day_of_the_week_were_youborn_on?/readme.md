# Bite 74. What day of the week were you born on?

## Description

Complete `weekday_of_birth_date` which takes a `date` object of a birthday and returns the corresponding weekday string.

For example Bob and Julian's birthdays return Saturday and Monday (that's why Bob is meant to relax and Julian to do all the work chuckle).

For this Bite you want to look at the `datetime` and `calendar` modules. Have fun!
