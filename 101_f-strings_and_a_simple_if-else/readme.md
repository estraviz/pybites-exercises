# Bite 101. f-strings and a simple if/else

The latest way to print to the screen in Python (>= 3.6) is with f-strings.

In this Bite we'll get you to calculate whether a person is able to drive or not based on their minimum age which is stored in the constant MIN_DRIVING_AGE.

Print name is allowed to drive or name is not allowed to drive based on the age being equal or greater than MIN_DRIVING_AGE.
