# Bite 5. Parse a list of names

In this bite you will work with a list of names.

First you will write a function to take out duplicates and title case them.

Then you will sort the list in alphabetical descending order by surname and lastly determine what the shortest first name is. For this exercise you can assume there is always one name and one surname.

With some handy Python builtins you can write this in a pretty concise way. Get it sorted :)
