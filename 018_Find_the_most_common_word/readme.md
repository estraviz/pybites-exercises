# Bite 18. Find the most common word

## Description

Write a function that returns the most common (non stop)word in [this Harry Potter text](https://bites-data.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/harry.txt).

Make sure you convert to lowercase, strip out _non-alphanumeric_ characters and [stopwords](https://bites-data.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/stopwords.txt). Your function should return a _tuple_ of (`most_common_word`, `frequency`).

The template code already loads the [Harry Potter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter) text and list of stopwords in.

Check the tests for more info - have fun!
