# Bite 103. Loop through a dictionary and pluralise a word

You're given a dictionary of people and the number of games they've won.

Use a for loop to iterate over the dictionary and print out the users name and how many games they've won in the following format: sara has won n games

To make it human readable, pluralise the word game to suit the number of games won.
