# Bite 108. Loop over a dict of namedtuples calculating a total score

In this Bite you calculate the total amount of points earned with Ninja Belts by accessing the given `ninja_belts` dict.

You learn how to access _score_ and _ninjas_ (= amount of belt owners) from no less than a `namedtuple`.

Why a namedtuple, you did not even mention a tuple yet?!

Good point, well in our Bites we might actually use them even more so let's get to know them here (if you have a free evening read up on the `collections` module as well and thank us later).

The function returns the total score `int`. You learn to write generic code because we test for an updated `ninja_belts` dict as well, see the TESTS tab.
