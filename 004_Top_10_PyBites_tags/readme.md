# Bite 4. Top 10 PyBites tags

## Description

In this Bite you will get the top 10 blog tags of our [PyBites blog](https://pybit.es/) (e.g. _python, flask, django, learning_).

Our tests suppose you will use a `collections.Counter` and we loaded a [static copy of our feed](https://bites-data.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/feed) so we can predictably test your code. The Pybites tags will need to be parsed from the xml tags within each (hint: you do not need an xml parser for this task).

_What are the PyBites guys most passionate about?_ See the tests and you'll know the answer. Then code your solution to make them pass.

Keep calm and code in Python! :)
