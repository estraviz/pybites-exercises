# Bite 225. Swap case PyBites characters

##Â Description

In this Bite you will swap case all _pybites_ characters (both lower- and upper case) for a given text.

Not much more as for our instruction, just complete `convert_pybites_chars` which should work like this:

```python
>>> from convert_chars import convert_pybites_chars
>>> text = "Today we added TWO NEW Bites to our Platform, exciting!"
>>> convert_pybites_chars(text)
'todaY wE addEd tWO NeW bITES To our plaTform, ExcITIng!'
```

(Note that all converted chars are in the string _pybites_)

Have fun and code more Python!
