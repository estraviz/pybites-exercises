# Bite 153. Round a sequence of numbers

It's time to get *math*ematical! In this Bite we ask that you complete the `round_up_or_down` function that receives a _transactions_ list of `float`s and an optional `up` argument.

If `up` is `True` (default) you round them **up** to the nearest full integer, if it is `False`, you round **down** to the nearest full integer. Return a new list with the rounded `int` values.

Use whatever method you see fit, good luck!
