# Bite 32. Don't let mutability fool you

##Â Description

In this Bite you are presented with a function that copies the given items data structure.

There is a problem though, the tests fail. _Can you fix it?_

This can be done in a one liner. If you know which module to use it will be easy, if not you will learn something new today.

Regardless we want you to think about Python's **mutability**. Have fun!
