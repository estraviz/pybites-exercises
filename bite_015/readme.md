# Bite 15. Enumerate 2 sequences

Iterate over the given names and countries lists. In each loop print the value of each and also the counter of the loop (starting at 1).

Here is the output you need to deliver:

```python
1. Julian     Australia
2. Bob        Spain
3. PyBites    Global
4. Dante      Argentina
5. Martin     USA
6. Rodolfo    Mexico
```

The 2nd column should have a fixed width of 11 chars, so between _Julian_ and _Australia_ there are 5 spaces, between _Bob_ and _Spain_, there are 8. This column should also be aligned to the left.

Ideally you use only one for loop, but that is not a requirement. Good luck and keep calm and code in Python!
