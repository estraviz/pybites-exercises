# Bite 54. Nicer formatting of a poem or text

## Description

In this Bite you complete `print_hanging_indents` to print a poem (or text) in a nicer way.

For example calling it on (part of) [Christina Rosetti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christina_Rossetti)'s _Remember_ it should convert:

                      Remember me when I am gone away,
                      Gone far away into the silent land;
                      When you can no more hold me by the hand,

                      Nor I half turn to go yet turning stay.

                      Remember me when no more day by day
                      You tell me of our future that you planned:
                      Only remember me; you understand
to:

```code
Remember me when I am gone away,
    Gone far away into the silent land;
    When you can no more hold me by the hand,
Nor I half turn to go yet turning stay.
Remember me when no more day by day
    You tell me of our future that you planned:
    Only remember me; you understand
```

**`print`** the resulting poem (don't return it)! The tests include another text snippet from [Shakespeare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare). Have fun!
