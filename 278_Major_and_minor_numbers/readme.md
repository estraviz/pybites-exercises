# Bite 278. Major and minor numbers

##Â Description

You are given a list of integers. Write code to find the majority and minorty numbers in that list.

Definition: _a majority number is the one appearing most frequently, a minority number appears least frequently._

Here is a simple example how it should work:

```python
>>> numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3]
>>> major_n_minor(numbers)
(2, 1)
```

**Note -** you can assume that there will be _only one_ of each.

_Hint: any built-in library that supports convenient and rapid tallies?_
