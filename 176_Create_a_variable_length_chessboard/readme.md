# Bite 176. Create a variable length chessboard

##Â Description

In this Bite you are going to print a chessboard to stdout (use `print`).

Complete `create_chessboard` that takes an optional argument `size` which sets the dimensions of the board (or grid).

This is how it should work:

```python
>>> from chessboard import create_chessboard
>>> create_chessboard(2)
 #
#

>>> create_chessboard(4)
 # #
# #
 # #
# #

>>> create_chessboard(8)
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
```
