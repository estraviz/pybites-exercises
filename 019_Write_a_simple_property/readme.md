# Bite 19. Write a simple property

##Â Description

Write a simple `Promo` class. Its constructor receives a name `str` and expires `datetime`.

Add a `property` called `expired` which returns a boolean value indicating whether the promo has expired or not.

Checkout the tests and `datetime` module for more info. Have fun!
